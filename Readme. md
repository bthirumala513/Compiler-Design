1.Purpose:The program is written in Lex to recognize whether a given input string is a valid identifier or not.
2.Structure of the Program:The program has three main sections:Definition Section→defines helper patterns like letter and digit.
Rules Section→specifies the pattern of an identifier and what to do when a match is found.
C Code Section→contains the main function to start lexical analysis.
3.Pattern Definition:A letter is defined as any alphabet from a–z or A–Z.
A digit is defined as any number from 0–9.
4.Rule for Identifier:The first character must be a letter.
The remaining characters can be either letters or digits.
If the input matches this rule,the program prints that the string is an identifier.
5.Working Principle:The program reads the input string.It checks whether the string follows the identifier pattern.
If yes,it prints that the string is an identifier along with the input.
If no,it produces no output(since no rule matches).
6.Examples:Input:abc→Output:abc is an identifier.Input:a1b2→Output:a1b2 is an identifier.
Input:Z99→Output:Z99 is an identifier.Input:123abc→No output,because an identifier cannot start with a digit.
Input:_abc→No output,because the program’s rule does not allow underscore at the start.
